# Even Odd

## Motivation
Natural numbers are either even or odd in nature. How do we check the parity of an integer in Python!?

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that contains an integer variable called `num`.
Using the modulo operator, check whether `num` is even or odd, and store the string 
`"even"` or `"odd"` in a variable named `result`.
