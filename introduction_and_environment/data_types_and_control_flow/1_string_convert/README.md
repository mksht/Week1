# String Convert 

## Motivation
By default the input() keyword captures data in a string format unless we explicitly type cast the input to a new type.

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string value stored in object `string`.
Your goal is to check whether the value is in upperCase, and if so convert the data into lowerCase. Otherwise, if value is in lowerCase, convert the data into upperCase and store the result in a new variable called `data`.
