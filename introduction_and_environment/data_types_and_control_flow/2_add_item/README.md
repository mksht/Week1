## Motivation
Dictionary is a collection of ordered or unordered key:value pairs.

## Problem Description
In the solution.py file, you will be provided with a dictionary called `d` which is hidden from you. Do not peek in the provided_code.py file! The keys in this dictionary will be integers in the range from 1-5 inclusive, except one number in the range will be missing. The values will be strings. Your goal is to use conditional statements to find the missing number in that range and add a new key-value pair to `d` with the missing key, and string value `"found it!"`.
