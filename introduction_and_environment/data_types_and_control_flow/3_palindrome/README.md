# Palindrome 

## Motivation
A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward. For example “anna”,
“civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words.

## Problem Description
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string value and store this in an variable called `word`.
Your goal is to check whether `word` is a palindrome or not. Create a variable `is_palindrome` and set this value to be the boolean value `True` if `word` was a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
