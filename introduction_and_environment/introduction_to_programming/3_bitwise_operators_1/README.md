## Problem Description 
Given two binary values `x` and `y`, compute the following bitwise operations. 

1.Bitwise AND (&)
2.Bitwise OR (|)
3.Bitwise NOT (~) of 'x'

In the the **solution.py** file, create three variables `ans_and`,`ans_or` and `ans_not` to store the resulting values of `x` and `y`, `x` or `y` and not `x` respectively.
