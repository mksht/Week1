1.just for myself I would like to know but I wasn't able to find what -U option does in installation
yes, -u stands for user. so pip install -U pytest would install pytest for the particular user as oppsed to global users.
but if you do sudo apt install python-pip, it would do it globally
One installs it through Python, the other through your computer's package manager
for python-pip installed through sudo but pytest installed through user, pytest --version wouldn't work because
you should be able to run it with python3 -m pytest
since it's installed via python it might need you to tell python to invoke it
as opposed to the command working by itself
Question: old python version 2.... installed through sudo so first, it would be python -m pytest --version, second,
why so old version? pytest versions also differ. pytest i downloaded through ubuntu is 4. something version
while 3 days ago when i downloaded it on windows command the version was 7. something. 
so currently if I used git bash (windows) i would use 7.1.0 version pytest, whil eon wsl/ubuntu i'd use 4.6.11 version
